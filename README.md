# BattleSimulator
Lord of the Rings Battle Simulator
Created as a project for computer science at Mount Royal University for Paul Pospicil. Code written by me is preceeded by comments describing the purpose of the function
All .h and makefile are written by me.

To use:
"Make" to assemble program. 

Run "./battle -t <path_to_field>" for test mode. Outcomes will always be the same

Run "./battle -r <path_to_field>" for random mode. Outcomes will change from one run to the next

May need to run "Make Clean" and re-make the program to clear cache and allow it to be random.

NOTE: Helmsdeep.txt is the only current working field, as Visual Studio has decided to replace some characters with others

TODO: Add "Kill Count" and display leaderboard at end
TODO: Powerups
